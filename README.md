# Kernel-Experiments
A sandbox for experiments using Geometric Kernels and its application on two-sample tests.

# Some preliminary plans for experiments

A few papers have popped up since the seminal paper by Alex Smola and group released their paper on using Kernels methods for two sample texts [[base-reference]], namely [[ref1]] and [[ref2]] (these references were sent to the Cyrus group). The recent result by [[Cyrus-et-al]] introduces Kernels on SPD manifolds, which promises improved power and computational complexity as compared to the previous iterations of the kernel method of the two sample test. The above claim warrants further testing, which involves testing the kernel on the following datasets:
